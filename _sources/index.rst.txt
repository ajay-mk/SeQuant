Welcome to SeQuant's documentation!
===================================
.. note::

    This documentation is under development and may not be complete yet.

SeQuant is a framework for performing symbolic algebra of tensors over scalar fields (regular tensors) and over operator fields (tensor operators in, e.g., quantum many-body physics).
In addition to symbolic manipulation it can numerically evaluate (with an appropriate external tensor backend) general tensor algebra expressions.

For getting started with SeQuant, refer to :doc:`source/readme`. See :doc:`source/install` for detailed installation instructions.
